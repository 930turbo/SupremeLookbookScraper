# SupremeLookbookScraper

This is a Java program that scrapes data from the SUPREME, specifically from the lookbook, and stores this data in a CSV file.

Program works by making HTTP requests to specific URLs, parsing the HTML content of the pages that are returned, and then extracting specific pieces of data from that HTML: product names, prices, and image URLs.
The extracted data is then stored in objects and printed as output in the CSV file created.
